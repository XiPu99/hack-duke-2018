## Why did we make Vanguard?
There is a stunning lack of health awareness that is prevalent even in developed countries like the United States. Many individuals which are outwardly healthy are actually already at high risk for future disasters like cardiovascular events. This "faux-health" is a reflection of the lack of widespread health education regarding important modifiable bio-markers and their impact on human health and longevity.
## What does Vanguard do?
Vanguard uses a scientifically verified high-accuracy algorithm based on significant human bio-marker data to generate an estimate of the user's level of health. Vanguard does this through user inputted health data; many users will not have access to the full battery of bio-markers, so missing values will be resolved through data imputation powered by machine-learning methods in order to provide accurate user profiles despite incomplete data.
